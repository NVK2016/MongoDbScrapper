# MongoDbScrapper
create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## Demo Link 
The web app is deployed on heroku and can be accessed by clicking <a href="https://mongoscrappernews.herokuapp.com/">Here</a>


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. I will assume that you already have Node.js and MongoDB installed locally. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1. clone the repository on your local machine. 
2. Then navigate to the cloned folder within it type 

    npm install
