# MongoDbScrapper
<hr /> 

create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

This app helps scraping all the tv shows from FOX news channels. Once the shows are scraped the user can save the articles in the mOngoDB leave or delete a comment for the same. 

## Demo Link
